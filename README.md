This project is about building a very bright LED array using 5730 SMD LEDs, which is one of the largest LED size in the market.

A 5730 LED can produce up to 50 lumens of light with 0.5W power. It can draw a current of 0.15A and the voltage drop is 3.4V.

We are using a 5V power supply to light the 4 LEDs in parallel.

To calculate the resistors to use,

5V - 3.4V = 1.6V

1.6V / 0.15A = 10.6667 Ohms

Therefore, each LED requires a 11 Ohms 1812 SMD resistor of 1W rating.

The aim of this project is to create a portable flashlight that is very bright in the dark.

You may like to use a hot plate to solder the 5730 SMD LEDs and then use a soldering iron to solder the 1812 SMD resistors.

Tips: JLCPCB offers cheaper price for small PCBs of 10cm by 10cm. You can panelize your PCBs to less than or equal to the dimension.

Hope you enjoy this project. Once again, I would like to thank JLCPCB for sponsoring this project, and please order your PCBs at https://jlcpcb.com/RAT
